Viewing a diff between two versions of a file helped me to see
that robots will definitely conquer the mankind soon.
I think that cons are that you can forget to save it in proper time.
But pros is that you can save only that is really important.
I think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately only because
its easier to search the diff in 1 log than in a couple.
I don't know how I can use the commands git log and git diff 
to view the history of files.
With or without using the version control i am still confident.
